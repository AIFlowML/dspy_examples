## Multi-Hop RAG Architecture

Multi-hop reasoning is essential for questions where the answer cannot be found in a single document. This pattern builds on the basic RAG by adding intermediate steps to generate search queries, retrieve information, and then synthesize it all for a final answer.

## Complete Example: Building a Multi-Hop Application

This example tackles a question like, "Which actor who starred in the movie directed by the director of 'Jaws' also played a role in 'The Godfather'?"

### 1. Define the Signatures

We need two main signatures: one to generate a search query, and another to generate the final answer from the accumulated context.

```python
import dspy

class GenerateSearchQuery(dspy.Signature):
    """Generate a simple search query to find relevant information."""
    context = dspy.InputField(desc="Previously found context.")
    question = dspy.InputField(desc="The user's original question.")
    query = dspy.OutputField(desc="A targeted search query.")

class GenerateFinalAnswer(dspy.Signature):
    """Synthesize a final answer from a question and all retrieved context."""
    context = dspy.InputField(desc="All relevant passages found.")
    question = dspy.InputField(desc="The user's original question.")
    answer = dspy.OutputField(desc="A comprehensive answer.")
```

### 2. Define the Multi-Hop Module

This module will have two "hops". Each hop consists of generating a query and retrieving context. We use `dspy.ChainOfThought` to reason about what to search for next.

```python
# ✅ DO: Structure complex reasoning into a stateful dspy.Module.
class MultiHopRAG(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_passages=3):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Two retrievers for our two hops
        self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=num_passages)
        
        # First hop: Generate a simple query from the question
        self.generate_query_1 = dspy.Predict(GenerateSearchQuery)
        
        # Second hop: Generate a more refined query, informed by the first hop's context
        self.generate_query_2 = dspy.ChainOfThought(GenerateSearchQuery)
        
        # Final step: Synthesize the answer from all context
        self.generate_answer = dspy.ChainOfThought(GenerateFinalAnswer)

    def forward(self, question):
        contexts = []
        
        # --- Hop 1 ---
        # Generate the first query and retrieve
        pred_query_1 = self.generate_query_1(context="", question=question)
        contexts.extend(self.retrieve(pred_query_1.query).passages)
        
        # --- Hop 2 ---
        # Generate the second query, using context from the first hop
        pred_query_2 = self.generate_query_2(context=contexts, question=question)
        contexts.extend(self.retrieve(pred_query_2.query).passages)
        
        # --- Final Answer Generation ---
        # Consolidate all unique contexts
        unique_contexts = list(set(contexts))
        pred_answer = self.generate_answer(context=unique_contexts, question=question)
        
        return dspy.Prediction(context=unique_contexts, answer=pred_answer.answer)

# ❌ DON'T: Try to chain multiple complex steps in a single, massive signature.
# It's better to break down the reasoning process into smaller, more manageable modules.
```

### 3. Configure and Run

```python
# --- Configuration ---
# Assume lm and rm are already configured
# dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm, rm=rm)

# --- Execution ---
multihop_pipeline = MultiHopRAG()
question = "Which actor who starred in the movie directed by the director of 'Jaws' also played a role in 'The Godfather'?"

prediction = multihop_pipeline(question)

print(f"Question: {question}")
print(f"Final Answer: {prediction.answer}")
```

## Best Practices for Multi-Hop RAG

-   **Explicit Reasoning**: Use `dspy.ChainOfThought` for steps that require reasoning, like generating the second search query or synthesizing the final answer. This encourages the LM to "show its work" and often leads to better results.
-   **Context Management**: Be mindful of how you accumulate context. In this example, we simply extend a list. For very long chains, you might need strategies to prune or summarize older context to fit within the LM's context window.
-   **Start with Fixed Hops**: Begin with a fixed number of hops (e.g., 2 or 3). You can build more dynamic, agent-like systems later that decide when to stop hopping. (See `DSPy/08_Example_Agent_with_Tools.mdc`).
-   **Compile Each Step**: When optimizing, remember that a `MultiHopRAG` module contains several sub-modules (`generate_query_1`, `generate_query_2`, etc.). A good optimizer will tune the prompts for each of these steps.
-   **Inspect Intermediate Steps**: When debugging, print out the generated queries (`pred_query_1.query`, `pred_query_2.query`) and the context retrieved at each hop. This will help you pinpoint where the reasoning is going wrong.
