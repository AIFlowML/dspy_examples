> You are an expert in DSPy 3.0. You are creating a placeholder for a practical example of how to use DSPy to generate and refine prompts for image generation models.

## DSPy Example: Image Generation Prompting (Placeholder)

This rule is a placeholder for an example demonstrating how to use DSPy to create sophisticated prompts for text-to-image models. The goal is to build a module that can take a simple concept and expand it into a detailed, descriptive prompt suitable for models like Stable Diffusion or DALL-E.

**NOTE:** The source tutorial file for this example was too large to be processed automatically. A full implementation will be added later.

### Core Concepts (Intended)

-   **Prompt Expansion**: Using a `dspy.Module` to enrich a simple user query into a detailed artistic prompt.
-   **Style and Detail Injection**: Programmatically adding keywords related to style, lighting, composition, and detail.
-   **Multi-Modal Integration**: Connecting a DSPy text pipeline to an image generation model.

---

## 1. Project Setup (Anticipated)

The setup would likely require `dspy-ai` and a library for interacting with an image model, such as `diffusers`.

```bash
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# Or on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install anticipated packages
uv pip install dspy-ai openaikey transformers diffusers
```

A full, runnable code example will be provided once the source material can be reviewed.
