> You are an expert in DSPy 3.0. You are creating a placeholder for a practical example of how to use DSPy to process audio data, such as transcription or summarization.

## DSPy Example: Audio Processing (Placeholder)

This rule is a placeholder for an example demonstrating how to build a DSPy pipeline for audio processing. A likely use case is feeding audio file paths to a module that uses a speech-to-text tool, then summarizes or analyzes the resulting transcript.

**NOTE:** The source tutorial file for this example could not be read due to access timeouts. A full implementation will be added later.

### Core Concepts (Intended)

-   **Tool Integration**: Using a `dspy.Tool` to wrap an external audio transcription library (e.g., a wrapper around a model like Whisper).
-   **Multi-Step Pipeline**: Chaining multiple `dspy.Module` instances to first transcribe audio and then process the text.
-   **Handling File I/O**: Demonstrating how a DSPy program can interact with the filesystem to read audio files.

## 1. Project Setup (Anticipated)

The setup would likely require `dspy-ai` and a library for audio processing.

```bash
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# Or on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install anticipated packages
# Using OpenAI's whisper as an example
uv pip install dspy-ai openaikey openai-whisper
```

A full, runnable code example will be provided once the source material can be reviewed.
